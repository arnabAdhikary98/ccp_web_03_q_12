# Basic DOM Manipulation

## Problem Statement

Build a simple webpage with the following structure:

- A `<ul>` with three `<li>` items.
- A `<button>` with the text "Add Item".

Write JavaScript to:

- Select the `<ul>` using `querySelector` and add a new `<li>` element with the text **"New Item"** whenever the button is clicked.
- Ensure each newly added `<li>` is styled:
  - With **bold font & blue color** if its sequence number is odd.
  - With **italic font & red color** if its sequence number is even.
